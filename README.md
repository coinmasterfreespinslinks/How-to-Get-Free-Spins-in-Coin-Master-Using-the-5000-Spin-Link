### What is Coin Master?

Coin Master is a popular mobile game that combines elements of slot machines, strategy, and village building. Players spin a virtual slot machine, earning rewards like coins, shields, attacks, and raids. These rewards help them build and upgrade their village, attack other players’ villages, and collect cards to complete sets. 

The core of the game is the "spins" mechanic, which players need to acquire in order to make progress. Spins are limited, and they regenerate over time, but they are a vital resource for success in the game.

### Why Do You Need Spins in Coin Master?

In **Coin Master**, spins are the key to earning coins, which you need to build your village. You can also attack and raid other players’ villages to collect more coins, but these actions require spins. Without spins, you can’t raid, attack, or open chests, leaving you stuck. The more spins you have, the faster you can advance in the game.

Spins are usually replenished at a fixed rate, but you can also buy them through in-app purchases. However, if you don’t want to spend real money, there are free methods to get spins.
